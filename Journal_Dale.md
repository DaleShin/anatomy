Final Group Project: A site that explains parts of the body interactively. 
						         (We still have not decided on a detailed topic yet)
                     
What the instructor needs :

1. Major Interactive Function
2. Clickable Page (ex. open things up&close), Multiple page.
3. Event element (grab a attention more than a minute)
4. Same layout but differnt contents. (Sasswise! same elements, same grouping)
5. Time line.

Brainstorming for ideas

For what reasons do you intend to introduce each organs? 
What are the organs in charge of the most important part of the human body? 
They show their functions as animations and vector images. 
It is too much to describe all the organs of a human being. 
It is appropriate to describe five to eight organs contained in one large context. Hereâ€™s examples below. 

Ex1. Only the organs that help to absorb when drinking water and function in the body are explained. 
Ex2. The commands and muscles of the cell that are necessary for human walking. 
Ex3. Describe the process of ingesting food and defecation. (major interactive function) 
     Describe the role of the organs that play the most important role in the process.(sub interactive function) 
Ex4. Each nutrient comes into our body and helps us. 
Ex5. Symptoms that occur within 5 minutes when the heart stops 
Ex6. Explanation of bones in our body, position and connection state of bevelling, direction of movement explanation 
Ex7. The side effects of High blood pressure on the body 
Ex8. Types of blood vessels in our body, arteries, capillaries, veins. 
     Explain the institutions that are related to where they go 
Ex9. 12 Cranial Nerves & Basic functions. 
Ex10. Animation of each institution and air intake and exhaust processes required for breathing.

Substantial Journal.

I remember that Emmet and Sass were installed at the beginning of the class, and I used it to the terminal, so I came with a lot of burden. I think even Emitt mistakenly thought it was a computer language and increased the burden even more by myself.
I wrote the Emmit command in a notebook, and even Sass studied alone while watching YouTube. I could not follow Hamilton's coding work during the class. It was a bit difficult to understand what he said while he writing the code in the class. So I recorded his voice so that I would not miss anything in class.Frustration keeps me in a position to get me into trouble, but When I thought that it was not only hard for me, frustration would soon disappear and I had a desire to study more deeply. 

By the way, it was more helpful for me to make something by myself than to memorize a specific command while writing a notebook from Youtube. Now I know why coding is called language. I was foolishly more difficult to connect the Sass and SubLime editors using terminals than to create layouts using Sass early on. I remember going to the workshop for about two weeks and asking only terminal connection with Sass.Eventually, after reaching mid-term, I found out how to connect the Sass and terminal via YouTube. 

Every minute in the Final in Group project, I was frustrated with JavaScript. JavaScript was necessary and important, not only in the this class but also in other classes.I have been thinking about why I have not studied what I need, and I decided to study Java more effectively than anyone else. Sass was not that hard to study and seemed to be good, but the need for JavaScript became increasingly than became a difficult. In the final project, I focused on concept and visual design because of fear of Java. 

About two weeks ago, Hamilton said that in the class, it is not just to learn computer language but to learn the attitude and ability to solve problems when faced with problems. I thought Java was not a difficult language, but a fun language. As I was working on the Final Project, I found myself struggling with the most basic positioning.Hamilton asked at the presentation. He asked me later on how you would improve your coding skills, and I would like to say that instead of listening to lectures on YouTube, I will build a small project every day and build up my skills. The reason why I do that way is that learning and solving problems directly leads to long learning and making fun. If you have fun, you can keep it for a long time without stopping.
